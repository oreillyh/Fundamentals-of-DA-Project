    "In their paper, 'Visual Presentation of Data by Means of Box Plots', [1] the authors discuss the use of boxplots as a useful means of interpreting *robust statistics*, i.e. those statistics which describe data with outilers better than those statistics based on the normal distribution. The authors explain how the use of the median as a descriptor and the interquartile range used in Box plots better describe the central tendency and dispersion of the data, respectively. They also explain how the whiskers are used to describe the range of the data.\n",
