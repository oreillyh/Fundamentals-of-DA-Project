The authors explain how the use of the median as a descriptor and the interquartile range used in Box plots better describe the central tendency and dispersion of the data, respectively. They also explain how the whiskers are used to describe the range of the data.\n",

    "#### THE DATASET\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was a real world one and was extremely stacked in nature. Attempts were made to reshape it but ultimately due to the scope of the project it was decided to select a small number of years of data and create boxplots from them, i.e. 5 yr intervals from 1984 to 2014. Selecting a very large real world dataset, while making the assignment more challenging proved a learning experience on how data wrangling is a key element of data analytics. These challenges highlighted the fact that not all datsets are presented in a manner which lends itself to easy analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### BOXPLOTS\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**STANDARD BOX PLOTS**\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic boxplot is a useful visual which enables a complete overview of the distribution of the entire dataset. In the context of the daset used here it allowed comparison of the tax data distribution over the years by tax type. Each quartile, mean, and overall distribution could be clearly viewed in a way that is easier to interpret then a table of figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**VIOLIN PLOTS**\n",
    "\n",
    "Violin plots have a standard boxplot and the \"violin plot features a kernel density estimation of the underlying distribution\" ref: https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.violinplot.html?highlight=violin. The addition of the KDE adds another layer of information to the boxplot. Knowledge of the underlying nature of the data distribution is an important aspect of data analysis as it determines subsequent statistical analysis on parametric data. Non-parametric data distributions are tested using non-parametric statistical tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "The violin plot of our own data is not providing a useful visualisation as the KDE is quite smooth. This may be due to the small size of the dataset used. \n",
    "\n",
    "**SWARMPLOTS**\n",
    "\n",
    "Swarmplots, ref: https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.swarmplot.html#seaborn.swarmplot perovide another means of visualising the underlying distribution of the dataset along with the visual and information conveyed by the standard boxplot.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SUMMARY STATISTICS**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "As with most datasets, the summary statistics provide only part of the story. Most notably the presence of negative values in the dataset created an inaccurate analysis - as no explanation was provided with the dataset it is difficult to know why negative data were reported. Nevertheless, a combination of summary statistics and the graphical visualisations of the data using plots and boxplots created a better overall picture of the nature of the dataset."
